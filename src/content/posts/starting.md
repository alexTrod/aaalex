# Keeping tracks of my tribulations

### I will try to leave here traces of the evolution of projects, ideas and impulsions. The goal is mainly to put pressure on myself and creating a sense of duty that will hopefully allow for more discipline and persistence. The ultimate goal is persitency and consistency. Beyong that, it is to ease an already fading memory and keep some data out of it to avoid overflowing and ensure I will be able to remember I did - at least - something, in the future when enough experimentation will gain over my ability to use my brain in the same ways I can do now. So also preservation. <mark> Persistence, concistency and preservation. </mark>Let's start.
